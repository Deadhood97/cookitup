# Cook It Up! 🍳

**Cook It Up!** is a logic-based grid puzzle game where you combine ingredients to create delicious dishes. Inspired by the sliding mechanics of *2048*, this game adds a culinary twist with complex recipe chains, cooking mechanics, and "burn traps" that test your logical planning.

## 🎮 How to Play

Use your **Arrow Keys** or **WASD** to slide all tiles on the grid.
- **Combine**: Slide two identical ingredients together to merge them (e.g., `Flour + Water = Dough`).
- **Transform**: Interact with stationary tools or elements (e.g., `Dough + Fire = Bread`).
- **Goal**: Complete the specific recipes required for each level before you run out of moves or space!

### ⚠️ Watch Out!
- **Burn Traps**: Don't throw raw ingredients directly into the fire! `Tomato + Fire` = `Burnt Goop`. You must prepare your ingredients first.
- **Time Limits**: Some levels, like the *Delivery Rush*, require you to cook against the clock.
